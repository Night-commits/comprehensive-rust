# Scopes and Shadowing

You can shadow variables, both those from outer scopes and variables from the
same scope:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let a = 10;
    println!("before: {a}");

    {
        let a = "hello";
        println!("inner scope: {a}");

        let a = true;
        println!("shadowed in inner scope: {a}");
    }

    println!("after: {a}");
}
```
