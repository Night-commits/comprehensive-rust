# Glossary

The following is a glossary which aims to give a short definition of many Rust
terms. For translations, this also serves to connect the term back to the
English original.

<!-- Translators: please list the English term in italic after your translation.
For Danish, this would look like this: `allokere (_allocate_)`. -->
